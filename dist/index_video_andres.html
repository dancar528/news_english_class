  <h2>CAPTURED REAL ESTATE SCAMMERS WHO HAVE RAISED MORE THAN HALF A BILLION PESOS</h2>
  <p>Lately, in Antioquia, several large real estate scams have been uncovered. In June of this year, 6 people were captured in Medellín, related to the InverNorte, W Group and Europa Construcciones real estate builders, for cheating more than 170 people in 46 real estate projects in Medellin and 10 in Bello.

    It is believed that these people have raised more than half a billion pesos in these frauds.
    
    Some of the charges charged are illegal urbanization and fraud in the form of mass crime.
    
    
    In the case of scams in Medellin, most of the projects were endorsed by a municipal procurator, who after being fired as a curator for corruption ended up working as an advisor to these construction companies. The modalities of scam included, among others, the sale of real estate that was never built, the demolition of real estate promising its owners to build a building from which they would receive some apartments as payment.
    
    As this are many other cases that have been affecting Antioquia for some years, let's not forget the case of the space building, located in the poblado neighborhood in Medellin, which in 2013 one of its towers collapsed causing the death of 12 people. Another similar case, the Bernavento building located in Medellin in the Colina de los Bernal, which collapsed in a controlled manner in 2018 due to its irremediable structural failures. Finally, the oriente antioqueño, unfortunately does not escape this problem, remember the controlled implosion of the building Altos del lago in Rionegro, carried out in May of this year, for structural failures.</p>
